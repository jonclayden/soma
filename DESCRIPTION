Description: An R implementation of the Self-Organising Migrating Algorithm, a general-purpose, stochastic optimisation algorithm. The approach is similar to that of genetic algorithms, although it is based on the idea of a series of ``migrations'' by a fixed set of individuals, rather than the development of successive generations. It can be applied to any cost-minimisation problem with a bounded parameter space, and is robust to local minima.
