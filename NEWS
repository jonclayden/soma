Significant changes to the soma package are laid out below for each release.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.2.0

- New T3A and Pareto strategies are now available, using helper functions for
  generating options, instead of the (previously unused and now defunct)
  "strategy" argument to `soma()`. See `?soma.options` for details of the new
  strategy types, their options and further references.
- Cost function evaluations are now counted and recorded in the `evaluations`
  element of `soma` objects. This is now used in the `plot()` method rather
  than just migration number.
- It is now possible to initialise the population explicitly, rather than at
  random.
- The code now tries much harder to avoid re-evaluating the cost function when
  individuals aren't moving in a given migration. This can save a lot of time
  when the objective is very expensive to calculate.
- A visual demo is now included with the package: try `demo(rastrigin)`.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.1.1

- A short README file has been added to the package.
- The LICENCE file is no longer needed and has been removed.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.1.0

- A plot function has been added for "soma" objects, which shows the history of
  leader cost values during the optimisation.
- The length of the cost history should no longer exceed the maximum number of
  migrations specified.
- The package now has a formal namespace.

=================================================================================

VERSION 1.0.0

- First public release.
